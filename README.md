Minecraft datapack with features that enhance roleplay and plot elements on a multiplayer survival world.

## Features
Each feature can be enabled or disabled:
- **Canon Lives:** Allow players to become ghosts after a certain number of plot-relevant deaths.
- **Protected Items:** Allow players to mark items as canon/unique, giving them unique protections.
- **Bloodlust:** Players gain maximum health each time they slay another player until they die themselves. If a player becomes too powerful in this way, a boss bar with their name on it appears.
